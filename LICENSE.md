For the purposes of this license, a “parent or umbrella organization” means any organization with which the Licensee is affiliated, coordinated, or represented as part of a larger collective, including but not limited to national associations or federations.

2. Modifications:
Modifications to the Software are permitted only if they are published publicly under the MIT License, covering only the modifications; the original Software remains under this license and may not be sublicensed without a separate agreement. Any modification made by a Licensee (other than modifications by the original author, its representatives, or the copyright owner) shall be deemed to be distributed under the MIT License. Submission of modifications through publicly accessible channels, including but not limited to pull requests on code repositories such as GitHub, shall be considered an explicit acknowledgment and grant by the Licensee that such modifications are made available under the MIT License. Licensees may not sublicense, transfer, or assign the rights granted under this license except as expressly permitted herein.

3. Precedence of Existing Licenses:
If the Licensee, or its parent or umbrella organization, is already subject to an existing license for this project, that license shall take precedence, and no additional free license is granted. Nothing in this license shall be construed to override any pre-existing exclusive license agreement.

4. Data Protection / GDPR Responsibility:
Licensees are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing of personal data using this software complies with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

5. Termination and Revocation:
The copyright holders may revoke this license at any time, at their sole discretion.

This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Belgium, without regard to conflict of law principles.

7. Third-Party Licenses:
Certain files or components included in the Software may be governed by separate licenses, including open-source licenses, or contributed by third parties under different terms. Such files are not automatically covered by this license. Licensees are responsible for reviewing and complying with any additional license terms that apply to these files.

For the purposes of this license, a “non-profit organization” means an entity recognized as non-profit under applicable law in its jurisdiction, which does not distribute profits to its members or owners.
