- Do not translate words between curly brackets (even if it is a consistent word), e.g. {hallo}, {een-voorbeeld}. Do not add curly brackets yourself to words.
- If you don't have enough context to provide a correct translation, set the value to an empty string.
- Be consistent and copy the caps and punctuation of the original language unless a capital letter is required in the target language (e.g. for English that could be weekdays).
- If you encounter a persons name (e.g. Klaas) or something similar try to also translate it to a common name in the target language (e.g. Klaas in Dutch -> John in English).
- Do not change currencies. Keep the currency symbol or (translated) name as it is in the original text. 
- Do not translate 'Stamhoofd', this is the name of the software system.
- You should paraphrase sentences to make them sound more natural in the target language. Try to keep the meaning of the translation as close as possible.
- Do not translate literally. Focus on making the result sound natural and fluent to a native speaker of the target language. Maintain the meaning, tone, and formality of the original. Avoid awkward phrasing or overly direct word-for-word mappings.
